/**
 * A class for extracting iOS/watchOS/tvOS device information from the Launch
 * Services UTI database.
 *
 * Since this relies on undocumentated data sources, it should not be relied
 * on in production, but it's quite useful for making debugging tools prettier.
 *
 * Since the information comes from the system, users with out-of-date systems
 * will not be able to retrieve information for newer devices.
 *
 * JAAIOSDeviceInfoManager is fully thread-safe; a single instance may be used
 * from multiple threads at once. Lookup operations are usually fast, but this
 * isn't guaranteed â€“ for instance, retrieving the Simulator icon could
 * potentially trigger Spotlight indexing.
