Cocoa utility to retrieve iOS device icons from iTunes

This is a class which allows you to map an iOS device model identifier, like "iPad2,4", to an icon. The icons are extracted from resource files in iTunes. Since the existence and organization of these files is undocumented, and the relationship between device identifiers and resources is hard-coded, this is pretty fragile, but it’s potentially mildly convenient for custom development and debugging tools that work with iOS devices.
